Project with the test for Rindus

## Second Part

- The scenarios for the second part are in the folder `features`
- To run the scenarios use the class `RunnerTest.java`
- To check the HTML report check the folder `target/systemTestReports/html`

## Comments
- I could not configure the project to run from the console.
- I could not configure a better selector for the quantity button. The page renders an element that the driver does not identify in some cases.
